# osu-dmenu-skin-elements-changer
Really dirty script (the first one that I've made in my life, actually), but hey, it works! 


Showcase of what it's capable of in it's current state:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9sa8LTaiTA (in Russian, but all the menus are in English)

``Dependencies:
dmenu
Probably any Notification Manager in existence, tested with dunstify``

Feel free to submit any issues or PR's to clean up some of the dirtiness that I've made!
